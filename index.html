    <h1>Quasar Came Back From the Other Side</h1>
    <h2>I felt the tremors as a ship cascaded in to port.</h2> 
    <p>The hushing of pneumatic
        tubes, the low frequency wobbles turn into a whining and then into silence
        before the dull click and dud of the airlock.
    </p> 
    <p>I looked up from our 
        oblong and into the viewport that looked over the landing pad. I could see
        the ship coming in  , the lights of the landing gear, the bright red of the
        thrusters.  The roof of the diner shook and the lights flickered. 
        The manoleum bar was cold on my forearms and I could taste the warm smell 
        of dough basting in the oven. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thee clock on the wall was broken. Several hours off of
        the time I had in my AR display. Which actually corrected
        the clock on the wall for me. I don't even know why I had 
        that damn thing, an artifact from another time, a piece of 
        a world that no longer existed. I guess I just liked the way
        it made me feel, but once that thing ran out of juice, it seemed like
        the gig was up.
    </p>
        You'd think at the remotest corners of the universe 
        people would be a little more decent, like they'd give you a curteous call
        befor pulling into port. You could never tell, especially these days--
        whether incoming parties meant you ill or harm. 
    <p>But of course it's not like that,
        and maybe it wasn't ever. It's damn near hard to tell. 
        At the end of the day, I'm just an fool for feelings, thinking
        things would be different out here. I used to think that--that            
        things would be so much bette--if I could only just get out where
        I was and get to where I was going.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Of course, what I really needed, and what
        I can see from the benefit of hind-sight was that I needed to get out of my own
        damned head. Anyways, that's all in retrospect, for now--looking 
        forwards and backwards again; it all seems like the cookie never turns the way you
        really want it to, and I guess that's the real tragedy of it all.
        And you know, the real fucked up part about all this? 
        At the end of the day--I'm just a pizza cook in this damn diner 
        at the edge of the universe. 
    </p>
        I have no money and no real skills to get me out of this
        this crater-covered circumstance. I'm just some hapless happenstancer
        dreaming for some glorious luck to finally bestow the best of myself 
        upon myself, and I sure as hell don't have the energy to put that all
        together, so I'll just leave it to chance. Maybe if I'm lucky a meteor
        will just wipe this whole place out and leave me to cascade through space
        like some pizza dough. 
    <p>
        And you know, I couldn't have guessed that Quasar would come back from out in the cold, that <em>that motherfucker</em> would find his way back here. He sat down
        in the corner booth and looked over his shoulder like I should've known he'd be coming back all along, but the truth was that I wasn't expecting him, and I sure as hell
        wasn't excited to see him. That is not at first, that is until he had a few too many beers and he started talking about what he'd found. 
    </p>
    <p>
        He held a book out in front of him, almost over his head like some priest
        displaying a holy scripture, it was brown and leather-bound--the likes 
        of which you don't see all that often--especially in a dingy dive like mine.
        He came up to me with that dirt eating grin, those jagged teeth, and that--that
        baleful smile.
    <p>
        I didn't move as he sauntered towards me, I kept on acting like I wasn't the 
        only soul in the whole place. Like his presence wasn't a real downer on my
        day. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, it didn't stop him, and he sure as hell didn't turn around and
        head out back through the door the way I'd hoped he would, he walked right
        up to me without saying anything, placed the book open in front of 
        me and straddled the stool on the other side of the linoleum. He never took his
        paws off the damn thing. He possessed it in such a way as to let me know that
        he was never going to give it up, but he wanted me to see what he had. 
        I could smell the sweet scent in the air. I could
        tell he had something special and that he wasn't going to give it up so easy, 
        but hell, what could you do? So I just listened to him read from the book, 
        because I knew the more he read the more I would know about what was happening in the wider galaxy. That is until Phoenix came walking through the door. Talk about someone who's always shitting on a good time. Never letting a person breathe.
